# le bot

A goofy ahh bot that sends dumb, overused memes on the slightest provocation. This included wenomechainsama and beast boy 4 meme.
It is really fkn simple just watch a yt video on discord.py and you can figure out the rest.

# How to use

To set up the bot go into a venv if u wish to keep it seperate from the rest of your python install and run
On Linux/Mac:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -U nextcord
```
On Windows:
```console
pip install nextcord
```

Now go into the discord developer portal where you have hopefully set up a bot if you followed the instructions to watch a YouTube video about discord.py and get the TOKEN from there.
Paste the TOKEN into the specified field in the .env file. If there is no .env file, make a file named `.env` and type: `TOKEN=`, then put the token right next to the equals (=) sign, no brackets, apostrophes or spaces.

Now run main.py
